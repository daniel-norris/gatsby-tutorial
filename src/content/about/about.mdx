Hey, I’m Dan. I live in Bristol, UK and I’m a Software Engineer at LexisNexis, a FTSE100 tech company that helps companies make better decisions by building applications powered by an OSS big data platform.

I have a background and over 5 years experience as a Principal Technical Recruiter and Manager. Some of my clients have included FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 organisations including Marsh, Chubb and Hiscox.

After deciding that I wanted to shift away from helping companies sell their tech enabled products and services and start building them myself, I graduating from a tech accelerator called DevelopMe\_ in 2020 and requalified as a Software Engineer. I enjoy creating seamless end-to-end user experiences and applications that add value.

In my free time you can find me rock climbing around local crags here in the UK and trying to tick off all the 4,000m peaks in the Alps.
