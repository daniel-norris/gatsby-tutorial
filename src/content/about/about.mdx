Hey, I’m Dan. I live in Bristol, UK and I’m a Software Engineer at LexisNexis, a FTSE100 tech company based out of Cardiff.

I have a background and over 5 years experience as a Principal Technical Recruiter and Manager. Some of my clients have included FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 organisations including Marsh, Chubb and Hiscox.

After graduating from a tech accelerator called DevelopMe\_ in 2020, I requalified as a Software Engineer. I enjoy creating seamless end-to-end user experiences that add value.

In my free time you can find me rock climbing around local crags here in the UK and trying to tick off all the 4,000m peaks in the Alps.
